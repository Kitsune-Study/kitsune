&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Material fatigue - lack of innovation of learning process and revisions, which leads to procrastination.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Lack of tools, ways for learning material from different angles, ex. reading, listening, speaking, writing.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Learning materials scattered all over the internet, instead of in the single place.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Hard to get back and rehearse your knowledge in an easy way. No automation. No challenging tasks.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - If there are high quality materials, then they are costly.
